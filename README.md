# SDIC 2022——PHAS0077: Scientific Computing Individual Research Project

This project could be divided into two parts: first part concentrate on training models for price prediction of the future market; second parts focuses on the investigations on the trading signals. The example data could be found in folder "example_data"
The code has the following chapters:

# Price Prediction Model

This experiment includes two sub-tasks. First is to training the model with the 


This thesis is an applied study for the application of machine learning and signals in the trading market. This research presents several studies, which include the construction of the stock price prediction system based on linear models with L1 and L2 regularisation, bagging and boosting tree models, and the details in feature engineering and model optimisation. A neural network model was also constructed and applied to the system. Their performance was evaluated by the root mean square error under cross-validation, and the results were summed up and discussed at the end of the first part. The second part mainly concentrates on the investigation of the signals, which firstly examines whether the classical signals with a long history could still aid the trading in the current market, followed by the discussions on the technical chart analysis. The signals reflecting this method would then be introduced and verified.
The motivation is to verify the effect of machine learning in price prediction and use them to aid the trading positioning in the market. As for the indicators, since the market has been evolving throughout history, while the classical signals might have already lost their effect, verifying these signals was therefore carried out in this research.
This thesis also attempted to convert the technical chart analysis into signals that the machine could understand, as the traditional chart analysis heavily relies on the traders’ institution. The patterns were summarised into signals, and a trading algorithm was implemented to reflect this method.
